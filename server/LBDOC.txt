Longbow Server Documentation
============================

I decided that releasing something so complicated and customisable :D, and with the scripting,
i thought u lot would be better off with some documentation to help u :), but u're all VB
coders so i don't think anything should be a problem for u 2 solve :)

Installing
==========

Ok, look for the readme.txt file, its in there somewhere :), and run the setup.bat file, this
will copy the dlls needed to your system folder, its hard coded for
C:\windows\system, so u mite have to change something there. After that, open up the project
in VB, anyway, run the program and u should see it, a big black thing with helpings
of green text :)

Scripting
=========

This is probably the section i like the most, coz i spent so F***ing long on it :)
look around at the cgi-bin dir, i think theres a good helping of scripting in there
to help you figure out how to use it :)

If you think i should make some big fat wedge of html help files on the scripting, then
tell me,  dj_fuzzy_beast@hotmail.com.

and don't forget, VOTE FOR ME!!! :D
